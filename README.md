## Brief Description of Data

This data set contains information about the *75th percentile* SAT and ACT score for both math and English, admission rates, enrollment rates, and location for institutions all over the United States from 2020 to 2021. The given information can be helpful for students who are planning to apply to universities or colleges within the United states because they can compare their score to past data in order to see the chances of them being admitted to each university.

## Widgets

The first widget is for choosing the score range the user wants to see. This allows the user to see the data points clearer. The second widget is the check box for choosing which regions the user wants to see on the scatter plot. This allows users to eliminate the regions that they do not want to see in order to have a better focus on the information they want to find. The last widget is to choose which state the user wants to see for the average SAT and ACT score.

## Panels

This app is separated into 4 panels. The first panel shows an overview of the data set and 5 examples are pulled from the data set for the users to have a rough idea of what this data set contains. The second and third panels display the scatter plot of each standardized test and subject. This allows them to visually see the data in order to see the trends and relationship between the admissions rate and the test. Lastly, the table page shows the average score for each test for each state.
